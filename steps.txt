first section:
in math f(x) is a function with a state
creating useState with Js.


second section:
- react update the virtual DOM not the DOM itself
- setState is a sync operation
- console log useState
- hooks should be called inside the function
- Why can't we call hooks inside Loops or conditions?
   or in other words, why do hooks relay on call orders?

- Hooks are all about arrays
- react is the one keeping the State

-reverse-engineer hooks

there is nothing that useState can do and useReducer can't and vice versa
if you gonna wright a lot of logic use useReducer
